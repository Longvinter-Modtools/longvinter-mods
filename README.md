# longvinter-mods
Master repo that lists all mods repositories

Make a PR if you want your mod to be listed on modtools.

Duplicate mods are not accepted as long as the original mod is still supported by his owner.

For your PR to be valid, you need to create two files: module.json and manifest.json

module.json will contain informations and version of your mod
manifest.json will contain every files needed for the mod to work, with a sha to verify integrity (a tool to automate this will come later).

You can follow this dummy repo for guideline : https://github.com/tsukasaroot/hunter
